# Guardian News Classifier

A machine learning project to classify articles from *The Guardian* newspaper into predefined news sections using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification models.

## Overview

This project explores the application of topic modeling and text classification on news articles. It leverages Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and machine learning classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.) to categorize articles into sections such as Politics, Sports, Technology, and more.
